ðŸ›‘ Problem
SQL logic behind reports is often unclear to business users, leading to frequent support queries and reduced trust in data. Manual documentation is time-consuming, inconsistent, and rarely updated. This creates a communication gap between data teams and stakeholders, slowing decision-making and increasing operational overhead.

ðŸ’¡ Solution
Use LLMs to automatically generate plain-language summaries of SQL queries powering dashboards. These AI-generated explanations clarify joins, filters, and logic, making data more accessible. Summaries can be embedded into reports or exported as documentation, reducing manual effort and improving understanding for both technical and business users.

âœ… Benefits
LLM-powered SQL summarization improves data transparency, reduces documentation time by 70â€“80%, and cuts support queries by up to 50%. It accelerates onboarding, enhances audit readiness, and supports self-service BI. Overall, it increases productivity and builds trust between analytics teams and business stakeholders.

ðŸ“‹ Details
The system uses an LLM to interpret SQL queries and produce natural-language summaries. Input can be raw SQL or extracted from BI tools. Summaries highlight selected fields, joins, and filters, and can be displayed in dashboards, metadata, or documentation. Integration is flexible via API, UI, or scripts.

ðŸ”§ Feasibility
The solution is feasible using GPT-based APIs and SQL parsers. A basic prototype can be built in weeks with minimal infrastructure. It integrates with existing tools and requires no changes to data sources. Human review ensures quality, and the system is scalable, secure, and cost-effective to maintain.

feasibility use this and condense to 50 words Technically, this use case is highly feasible using existing LLM platforms (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock). SQL parsing and prompt engineering can ensure accurate and context-aware summaries. Integration with BI tools or SQL repositories is achievable via APIs. A small PoC can be built in under 4 weeks with minimal infrastructure, using a Python backend and LLM API calls. Human validation during early phases ensures trust and improvement. Since the approach does not modify data, it poses minimal risk. Costs can be managed with batching or caching, and the system can scale easily with demand.
