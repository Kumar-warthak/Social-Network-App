Here are well-defined hypotheses for your LLM-based SQL summarization prototype (PoC), structured for evaluation during the pilot phase:


---

✅ Primary Hypotheses for the PoC

1. H1 – LLMs reduce SQL documentation time

> Using LLMs will reduce the time required to document SQL queries for reports and dashboards by at least 60% compared to manual efforts.



2. H2 – LLM summaries are sufficiently accurate

> At least 85% of LLM-generated SQL summaries will be rated as accurate (score ≥4/5) by domain experts or report developers.



3. H3 – LLMs improve report comprehension for business users

> Business users will report at least a 30% improvement in their understanding of report logic after LLM summaries are integrated.



4. H4 – LLM use reduces support dependency

> There will be a 30–50% decrease in the number of clarification requests or support tickets related to report logic.



5. H5 – LLM adoption improves onboarding time

> New analysts or developers will onboard and become productive with existing reports at least 25% faster using LLM-enhanced documentation.



6. H6 – LLM integration does not introduce critical errors

> Less than 5% of summaries generated by the LLM will have critical inaccuracies that could mislead decision-making.
