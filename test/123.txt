To evaluate the impact of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for summarizing SQL queries behind reports and dashboards, several quantifiable metrics can be tracked. The most direct benefit is time savings—manual documentation of SQL logic typically takes 30–60 minutes per report, whereas LLMs can generate accurate summaries in under 10 minutes, resulting in up to 80% reduction in effort. The accuracy of LLM-generated summaries can be measured by subject matter expert reviews, with pilot studies often showing 90–95% correctness.

Further, implementing these summaries can lead to a 40–50% drop in support queries from business users, who now better understand the data logic without needing technical intervention. New analysts onboard faster, with a 30–40% reduction in ramp-up time to understand existing reports. Regular surveys of users can assess satisfaction, with many reporting improved confidence and usability when clear SQL explanations are provided.

Additional metrics like SQL coverage, QA defect reduction, and cost savings from analyst hours can further justify adoption. Overall, LLMs provide a scalable, cost-effective solution for translating complex SQL into business-friendly language, improving transparency, trust, and productivity across analytics teams.
