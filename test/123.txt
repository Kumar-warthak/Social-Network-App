Absolutely, here are some clear and professional use case statements for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize SQL queries used in reports and dashboards. These statements can help in proposals, documentation, or stakeholder discussions:


---

✅ Use Case Statements for LLM-based SQL Summary

1. Automated SQL Query Documentation

> Use an LLM to automatically generate plain-English descriptions of complex SQL queries used in reports and dashboards, enabling faster onboarding and easier maintenance.




2. SQL Lineage and Report Impact Analysis

> Summarize SQL queries to trace the flow of data from source tables to KPIs in dashboards, aiding in impact analysis during data model changes.




3. Report Metadata Generation

> Leverage LLMs to generate metadata for each report (e.g., fields used, filters applied, joins made) by analyzing the underlying SQL, helping with cataloging and discovery.




4. Self-Service BI Enablement

> Provide business users with LLM-generated summaries of SQL logic behind dashboards, reducing reliance on technical teams and improving trust in data.




5. SQL Quality Review and Optimization Insights

> Automatically summarize and comment on potential inefficiencies, repeated joins, or unnecessary subqueries in SQL logic powering reports.




6. Version Change Highlights

> When SQL logic changes between report versions, use an LLM to summarize the differences and highlight the business logic impact.




7. Audit and Compliance Reporting

> Translate complex query logic into audit-friendly summaries that explain how sensitive or regulatory data is filtered, transformed, and displayed.




8. SQL to Business Logic Mapping

> Bridge the gap between technical SQL queries and business definitions by using LLMs to interpret and map SQL constructs to business KPIs.




9. Natural Language Interface for SQL Insights

> Allow stakeholders to ask questions like “What does this report show?” or “Where is this metric sourced from?” and get LLM-generated responses based on SQL analysis.




10. Dashboard QA and Testing Support

> Use LLMs to explain SQL behind dashboard visuals to help QA analysts verify if the correct logic is applied and matches business expectations.
