Modern organizations often struggle with the complexity of SQL queries and programming code in platforms like Oracle, MS SQL, SSIS, SAS, and Python. Understanding intricate logic, creating new queries, or converting code between platforms requires deep technical expertise, slowing down project delivery and creating dependency on specialized resources. Non-technical stakeholders find it difficult to interpret technical scripts, leading to communication gaps between business and IT teams. Manual code migration and optimization further increase time, cost, and error risk. There is a clear need for an AI-powered solution that automates summarization, generation, and cross-platform translation of SQL and programming code.


Organizations face challenges in understanding, creating, and converting complex SQL queries and programming code across platforms like Oracle, MS SQL, SSIS, SAS, and Python. This complexity slows development, hinders collaboration, and limits accessibility for non-technical users, creating a need for automated summarization, generation, and cross-platform code translation.
